so, not a lot has been working out for me over the last week or so, I don't remember myself being productive or doing something usefull. I think I was just bummed out that my applications did not work I think, which is like not a big deal I was just randomly applying to linkedin easy applies with a half a**ed resume what did I even expect.
I know what I need to do, I just need to put my head down and work, give a new start to everyday it does not matter what I did yesterday, if I was very productive or I was a degenerate it hands down does not matter, I just need to focus on the day at hand and for that I am going to start the daily journal again. It does not matter if I don't get a job tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or next week or next month trust me in the grand scheme of things it will be the last thing that matters what matters is if I am satisfied with myself today, if I worked hard today, if I worked out today, if I talked to my people today yep thats what matters the most is today.

today started off really bad woke up verrry late, like I don't know what has happened to my sleep it has been at its worst state for like the last 3 days, but still I gathered myself and tried to start working at 11 but thennnn the internet went off and I had to get a recharge for the internet and that's it, that was all it took for me to get distracted so was not the most productive day of my like but still got some things done. Other thing that has been bumming me out lately is that the oss repos I have been trying to setup locally have been a real pain. I don't know why I have to literally just clone them and run docker compose that's it what can I mess up in that to not work. Anyways hopefully I start tomorrow better and get more things done.
