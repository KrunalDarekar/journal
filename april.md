### journal
so, not a lot has been working out for me over the last week or so, I don't remember myself being productive or doing something usefull. I think I was just bummed out that my applications did not work I think, which is like not a big deal I was just randomly applying to linkedin easy applies with an half a**ed resume what did I even expect.
I know what I need to do, I just need to put my head down and work, give a new start to everyday it does not matter what I did yesterday, if I was very productive or I was a degenerate it hands down does not matter, I just need to focus on the day and hand and for that I am going to start the daily journal again. It does not matter if I don't get a job tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or next week or next month trust me in the grand scheme of things it will be the last thing that matters what matters is if I am satisfied with myself today, if I worked hard today, if I worked out today, if I talked to my people today yep thats what matters the most is today.
