### journal
had a decent day even though my head was aching almost the whole day, I think I am gonna fall sick, lets hope for the best. I think the project fear is getting me again I am just afraid to start the shopping project, not afraid but I'm just procrastinating it a lot. we need to fix that and I need to put some priority next to the imp todos so that I know like I need to work on that think that particular day.
