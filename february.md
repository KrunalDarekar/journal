had a decent day even though my head was aching almost the whole day, I think I am gonna fall sick, lets hope for the best. I think the project fear is getting me again I am just afraid to start the shopping project, not afraid but I'm just procrastinating it a lot. we need to fix that and I need to put some priority next to the imp todos so that I know like I need to work on that think that particular day.

again a hectic day, had some function at my house but still managed to get some thing done so that was good. the open source thing is not as easy as I was expecting it to which I was expecting, the projects just run on so much older technology than what we are using rn but we'll figure it out, I promise myself that.

did not get anything done. I don't really know what to say but yep was scrolling the whole damn day. so that's bad, I should really work on my mornings. from today I am gonna write my todos beforehand so in the morning I already have something to do and not waste my prime time deciding what I have to do the whole day so yeah that's that.

had an even better day than yesterday, capitalized on my morning, which is I think the most important and does'nt matter if I slack off a bit during the day later. I think I went into deep work like two times because I had the motivation to finish the odin project react part yep very special moment for me to realise how far I have come. elbow was worse in the morning but better throughout the day hopefully that gets better and yeah that's it we'll see how tomorrow goes
