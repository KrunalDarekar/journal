had a decent day even though my head was aching almost the whole day, I think I am gonna fall sick, lets hope for the best. I think the project fear is getting me again I am just afraid to start the shopping project, not afraid but I'm just procrastinating it a lot. we need to fix that and I need to put some priority next to the imp todos so that I know like I need to work on that think that particular day.

again a hectic day, had some function at my house but still managed to get some thing done so that was good. the open source thing is not as easy as I was expecting it to which I was expecting, the projects just run on so much older technology than what we are using rn but we'll figure it out, I promise myself that.

had an even better day than yesterday, capitalized on my morning, which is I think the most important and does'nt matter if I slack off a bit during the day later. I think I went into deep work like two times because I had the motivation to finish the odin project react part yep very special moment for me to realise how far I have come. elbow was worse in the morning but better throughout the day hopefully that gets better and yeah that's it we'll see how tomorrow goes

And yep did not do much. things I need to start doing are:
    - mornings
    - the first thing I do, I should be confident that I can complete it

I am still going to work on my whiteboard project untill I am leaving for the movie, I tweeted and did the journaling early so that I don't forget it. So that's aobut it for today

does not look like I did much, but spent most of my day on the whiteboard-it project was stuck on a problem and got a lot of things done, with that project. I am seeing progress with badminton as well just my instincts are getting better nothing that I am enforcing. the cohort class was kind of cancelled and that's all for the day I guess.
