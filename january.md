### journal

had a decent day I think. Ate outside a lot, went outside with my buddy. had a good workout as it was a leg day so I did not have to use my elbow which was actin up yesterday.
even though I did not complete anything in spm today I did try, honestly it is just so boring. I am gonna try something tomorrow that might help me with this boring stuff.
I started the learnWeb3 bootcamp today.
I learned about the intrinsic motivators today which were I think: mastery, curiosity, autonomy, purpose and autotelicity
so these are motivators that come from within (unlike money, fame ect extrinsic motivators) I should find these motivators with whatever I am doing for now this is what it means for programming:
mastery: I want to become the best programmer in the world
curiosity: I want to learn how each and every technology works
autonomy: I want to build tech "my way"
autotelicity: I want to enjoy programming for the sake of it.
I want to work on these motivators

so had a really good day. first time completed all the todos that was nice. had a really nice coffee protein shake, moms back from her trip so she is cooking for me which is way nicer and saves me a lot of time so grateful for that. actually completed the memory game project today which was nice and tweeted about it.
I learned about how I should recover from the fatigue after getting into the flow state which helped me get into the zone twice today.
completed the 2 units of IOT which I assigned today.
other than that the usual learWeb3 and dsa lesson learned about doubly  linked list in that dsa lesson.
wanted to get a haircut today but that did not happen.
ending the day early today might do another dsa or web3 lesson or even an odin project lesson.

had a decent day. did not feel super good like yesterday and these days will and they'll come very often in the coming weeks as the exams will start but that is fine I'll do my best to tackle them.
I completed all my todos did not think that would happen during the day but eh it was not that hard. had a huge lunch gonna start working on my diet from the next week (having a huge lunch is good).
so tomorrow I'll have to go clg. if I return early that would be a good thing so I'll able to focus on my work more
I want to start writing articles on peakD on self improvement and my dev journey lets see I'll do something about that
that ends the day, might do another web3 lesson right now.
