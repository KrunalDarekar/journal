I want to start everyday by reading the last journal, the todos that I did not complete will have a reason next to them because of which I was not able to complete them so I will keep them in mind throughout the day.

### journal

had a decent day I think. Ate outside a lot, went outside with my buddy. had a good workout as it was a leg day so I did not have to use my elbow which was actin up yesterday.
even though I did not complete anything in spm today I did try, honestly it is just so boring. I am gonna try something tomorrow that might help me with this boring stuff.
I started the learnWeb3 bootcamp today.
I learned about the intrinsic motivators today which were I think: mastery, curiosity, autonomy, purpose and autotelicity
so these are motivators that come from within (unlike money, fame ect extrinsic motivators) I should find these motivators with whatever I am doing for now this is what it means for programming:
mastery: I want to become the best programmer in the world
curiosity: I want to learn how each and every technology works
autonomy: I want to build tech "my way"
autotelicity: I want to enjoy programming for the sake of it.
I want to work on these motivators
