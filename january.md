### journal

had a decent day I think. Ate outside a lot, went outside with my buddy. had a good workout as it was a leg day so I did not have to use my elbow which was actin up yesterday.
even though I did not complete anything in spm today I did try, honestly it is just so boring. I am gonna try something tomorrow that might help me with this boring stuff.
I started the learnWeb3 bootcamp today.
I learned about the intrinsic motivators today which were I think: mastery, curiosity, autonomy, purpose and autotelicity
so these are motivators that come from within (unlike money, fame ect extrinsic motivators) I should find these motivators with whatever I am doing for now this is what it means for programming:
mastery: I want to become the best programmer in the world
curiosity: I want to learn how each and every technology works
autonomy: I want to build tech "my way"
autotelicity: I want to enjoy programming for the sake of it.
I want to work on these motivators

Ahh went to the cloud computing class and it was useless! got nothing good for preparing the cc exam. so that just set the tone for the day. however I got the web3 lesson done before going to the class.
Did not do anything from the todo list today because I also had the cohort class today and debugging the dApp took a lot from me.

 had a decent day, didi made some spring rolls which were amazing but gave me some stomach problems.
 did everything except the learnWeb3 lesson and the workout plan I do have some time but I don't feel like working anymore so we'll see if my mood changes after going to a walk.
 the things that I learned today were pretty boring and won't really need them in my dev journey but just to understand legacy code.
 I am pretty sure I'll do even better tomorrow as I do not have a cohort class we'll see.
