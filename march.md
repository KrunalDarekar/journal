### journal
starting the march journal pretty late, not because I have not been studying instead studies have been pretty good. I have made like a board where I cross for every hour I study and a big cross if I study for the first 2 hours of the day.

The thing is I have been sick for like 2 days and my eyes water whenever I sit in front of my computer so studies have been a bit difficult (the project I am working on does not have a dark mode :') , and I have a reached a point in my skills where I think I can start finding jobs I just need to build a few projects and work on my resume and networking. To do all of that I think I need more structure in my day which the journal and the todo list is perfect for. so hope I get well soon and so I can get back to my mission of getting a job.
